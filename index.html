  <h2>Differences between 'switch' and 'if/else'</h2>
    <p>First, let's define 'switch' and 'if/else':</p>
    <p><strong>if/else:</strong> When using 'if/else', you're telling the
      program that if the statement was true then continue down the program,
      but if the statement was not true then execute the 'else' statement.  Once
      a statement is true, the program will exit the comparison.  if/else will
      check for values in a range.</p>
    <p><strong>switch:</strong> A switch statement will run through the list of
      cases looking for a match, and will compare to every case statement until
      it hits a break.  It will also only check data that is prespecified and
      equal to.</p>
    <p><strong>When you would use one or the other:</strong> Using 'if/else' is
      the better option when checking for values in a range and is ideal when
      trying to select between two options.  Using 'switch' is the better
      option when there's multiple options and you need the statement to spit
      out a value that matches.</p>
