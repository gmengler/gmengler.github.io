  <h2>Differences between 'switch' and 'if/else'</h2>
    <p>First, let's define 'switch' and 'if/else':</p>
    <p><strong>if/else:</strong> When using 'if/else', you're telling the
      program that if the statement was true then continue down the program,
      but if the statement was not true then execute the 'else' statement.  Once
      a statement is true, the program will exit the comparison.  if/else will
      check for values in a range.</p>
    <p><strong>switch:</strong> A switch statement will run through the list of
      cases looking for a match, and will compare to every case statement until
      it hits a break.  It will also only check data that is prespecified and
      equal to.</p>
    <p><strong>When you would use one or the other:</strong> Using 'if/else' is
      the better option when checking for values in a range and is ideal when
      trying to select between two options.  Using 'switch' is the better
      option when there's multiple options and you need the statement to spit
      out a value that matches.</p>

  <h2>Using '=' vs '==' vs '.equals'</h2>
      <p>What does each of these do?</p>
      <p><strong>=:</strong> '=' is used to assign values to variables.</p>
      <p><strong>==:</strong> '==' is used to compare variables to
        a constant to check for equality.  Typically used for conditional
        statements.  Can only be used with integers and doubles.</p>
      <p><strong>.equals:</strong> This will compare a string to another string
        and will only allow true or false.  '.equals' is the best way to compare
        <em>Strings</em> for equality.</p>

  <h2>Math.random()</h2>
      <p><strong>What is Math?</strong></p>
      <p>Math allows a program or application programmed in Java to execute
        various mathematic operations.</p>
      <p><strong>What is the return type of the ‘.random()’ method?</strong></p>
      <p>The typical return type for the '.random()' method is a double between
        0.0 and 1.0.</p>
      <p><strong>Why is the 'M' in 'Math' capitalized?</strong></p>
      <p>The 'M' is capitalized since 'Math.random()' is a class.  It is also
        proper etiquette for other programmers in order to more easily read
        your code.</p>
