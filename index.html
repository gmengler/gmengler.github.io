    <h2>Differences between 'switch' and 'if/else'</h2>
    <p>First, let's define 'switch' and 'if/else':</p>
    <p><strong>if/else:</strong> When using 'if/else', you're telling the
      program that if the statement was true then continue down the program,
      but if the statement was not true then execute the 'else' statement.  Once
      a statement is true, the program will exit the comparison.  if/else will
      check for values in a range.</p>
    <p><strong>switch:</strong> A switch statement will run through the list of
      cases looking for a match, and will compare to every case statement until
      it hits a break.  It will also only check data that is prespecified and
      equal to.</p>
    <p><strong>When you would use one or the other:</strong> Using 'if/else' is
      the better option when checking for values in a range and is ideal when
      trying to select between two options.  Using 'switch' is the better
      option when there's multiple options and you need the statement to spit
      out a value that matches.</p>

    <h2>Using '=' vs '==' vs '.equals'</h2>
      <p>What does each of these do?</p>
      <p><strong>=:</strong> '=' is used to assign values to variables.</p>
      <p><strong>==:</strong> '==' is used to compare variables to
        a constant to check for equality.  Typically used for conditional
        statements.  Can only be used with integers and doubles.</p>
      <p><strong>.equals:</strong> This will compare a string to another string
        and will only allow true or false.  '.equals' is the best way to compare
        <em>Strings</em> for equality.</p>

    <h2>Math.random()</h2>
      <p><strong>What is Math?</strong></p>
      <p>Math allows a program or application programmed in Java to execute
        various mathematic operations.</p>
      <p><strong>What is the return type of the ‘.random()’ method?</strong></p>
      <p>The typical return type for the '.random()' method is a double between
        0.0 and 1.0.</p>
      <p><strong>Why is the 'M' in 'Math' capitalized?</strong></p>
      <p>The 'M' is capitalized since 'Math.random()' is a class.  It is also
        proper etiquette for other programmers in order to more easily read
        your code.</p>

    <h2>Casting a double to an int</h2>
      <p><strong>What it means: </strong>Casting a double to an integer means
        manipulating what would otherwise be a number between 0.0 and 1.0 to any
        integer.</p>
      <p><strong>When you would do this and what is happening: </strong>You
        would cast a double to an int when you want a random number that falls
        outside of 0.0 to 1.0, like 1 to 10, 1 to 100, 1 to 1000, etc.  What
        happens is you would scale the double using another larger number eg.
        8*Math.random(), then insert '(int)' to cast X*Math.random() to an
        integer like this: (int)(8*Math.radnom()).<p>

    <h2>'for', 'while', and 'do while' loop differences</h2>
      <p><strong>'while' loop: </strong>Will repeat as long as a given
        condition/expression is true, it will also <em>only</em> execute if the
        condition is true.  'while' loops are best used when you are building an
        application where you are looking for a specific condition to be met</p>
      <p><strong>'do while' loop: </strong>Although similar to a 'while' loop,
        a 'do while' will always execute the body of the loop at least once, the
        condition/expression is then checked at the end of the loop.  'do while'
        loops are best used when you need to execute a loop to check what's in
        the condition.  The benefit of a 'do while' loop is to ensure a block of
        code is executed at least once.</p>
      <p><strong>'for' loop: </strong>'for' loops are designed to be executed a
        specified number of times as opposed to 'while' and 'do while' loops
        which will run as long as something is true.  'for' loops are best used
        when you know ahead of time how many iterations the loop needs to
        perform.  A 'for' loop could be used when trying to assign numbers to a
        given number of people.</p>

    <h2>import java.util.Scanner;</h2>
      <p>When you include <strong>import java.util.Scanner;</strong> at the top
        of your code, you're allowing it access to get information from the
        keyboard, files on a computer, or the internet.</p>
      <p>This functionality comes from a hierarchy.  It is importing various
        "folders" - starting with the java folder, then the util or "utility
        class" folder, and ending with the Scanner class that enables the code
        to take inputs from a user.</p>
  </div>

  <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
    <h2>'void' in a method declaration</h2>
      <p><strong>What is it?: </strong>'void' in a method declaration means that
        the method does not return a value.  A method with a return type will
        return a value, whether it be an int, double, string, etc.</p>
